Party rock, yeah, woo, let's go
Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gon' make you lose your mind
Everybody just have a good time
Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gon' make you lose your mind
We just wanna see ya, shake that
In the club party rock looking for your girl?
She on my jock huh non stop when we in the spot
Booty move away like she on the block
Where the drink I got's to know
Top jeans tattoo cause I'm rock and roll
Half black half white domino, gang of money out the door
Yo, I'm runnin' through these hoes like Draino
I got that devilish flow rock and roll no halo
We party rock, yeah that's the crew that I'm reppin'
On the rise to the top no lead in our zeppelin, hey
Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gon' make you lose your mind
Everybody just have a good time
Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gon' make you lose your mind
We just wanna see ya, shake that
Everyday I'm shufflin' shufflin' shufflin'
Step up fast and be the first girl to make me throw this cash
We get money don't be mad now stop, hatin' is bad
One more shot for us another round
Please fill up my cup don't mess around
We just wanna see you shake it now
Now you wanna be you're naked now
Get up, get down
Put your hands up to the sound
Get up, get down

I gotta feeling that tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feeling that tonight's gonna be a good night

A feeling, woohoo, that tonight's gonna be a good night

A feeling, woohoo, that tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
Tonight's the night, let's live it up
I got my money, let's spend it up
Go out and smash it like oh my God
Jump off that sofa, let's get, get off
I know that we'll have a ball
If we get down and go out and just lose it all
I feel stressed out, I wanna let it go
Let's go way out spaced out and losing all control
Fill up my cup, Mazel Tov
Look at her dancing, just take it off
Let's paint the town, we'll shut it down
Let's burn the roof, and then we'll do it again
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
And do it and do it, let's live it up
And do it and do it and do it, do it, do it
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
Cause I gotta feeling, woohoo,
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feeling, woohoo, that tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
