Delicious! I try to get here once every visit. Also, the sweetest people: On our most recent trip, my fiance and I went here with my niece's family. So total of 4 adults and 3 children (1 8y/o, 1 toddler, 1 baby). We were originally going to the market, but they were closed (on Memorial Day). My niece was unsure about taking the kids to a restaurant, but the Pho Cali folks were welcoming and patient, and we had a fantastic lunch experience. This is a great place to take your family for a restaurant experience. If you do, tip them very well. :)
