Came here on a Sunday and it was poppin. You can tell it's one of those hidden gem places. lots of vegan choices for the vegans out there but not that many regular options. i wanted some grilled pork on the side, not an option. but the broth here is amazing! i might be back but probably will do delivery, the area isn't the best for venturing
