So yesterday, my wife and I were in the neighborhood and wanted a bite to eat for lunch. Seeing as the area appears to have a significant Vietnamese population, we stumbled upon Pho Ha rather by accident. This was probably the happiest restaurant accident we've had in a while. It was only after getting to the counter to pay that I noticed that they've been Best of Philly for over half a decade. The pho broth was simply amazing, the large bowl was suitably impressive, and the price is very wallet-friendly. The accompaniments included a pleasantly generous amount of basil. And as one would hope, the orders were out with a very satisfying alacrity. It's easy to see why they are so poplar.
